# text_classification
Text classification using logistic regression.

# About
This project is a part of Computational intelligence course (CS-354) in Indian Institute Of Technology Indore.

# Requirements
1) pandas
2) numpy
3) scikit-learn
4) nltk
5) bs4
6) string
7) python-3

# Objectives
1) Implementation of "Logistic Regression" from scratch to carry out classification jobs.
2) Efficient preprocessing of text data.
3) Check accuracy scores on training and testing data.

# Platform
The project was made on "Pycharm community edition 2017.3" using "Anaconda3" packages.

# Drawbacks
1) Dataset is huge which makes it impossible to train using a normal PC.
2) Maximum of 20000 datasets can be trained in comparatively less time for result observations.

# Future Work
1) Use of big-data techniques to achieve a much more better result on training set considering usage of entire 1.6 million tweets.
2) Adcanced techniques for text preprocessing. eg- Emoticons and punctuations preprocessing which involve sentiments.
3) Training data using much powerful algorithms to achieve better score.
